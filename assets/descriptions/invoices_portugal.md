# Appy Invoices Portugal

## QR code scanner for invoices in Portugal

This app is a tool that allows you to:
- take pictures of bills and invoices and store them on your phone
- attach data to the stored invoices, like total value, date of purchase, etc.
- scan the QR code that is found on the invoice and extract data from it (currently only the QR codes of invoices in Portugal are supported)
- export the images and the stored data in certain formats (currently CSV and XML are supported)

The app is free and contains no ads. It uses the camera of the device only for the stated purpose and does not require any other permissions or use other resources.
The app stores all its data on the device and does not transfer any content over the internet.

Internally the app uses some libraries which may in turn perform some data collection for performance analysis. In particular, see:
